          <p>In 2019, the <i>“Un- Water policy”</i> by the United Nations created an analytical statement in the cause of water sustainability. In the first paragraph of the article, it says, <i>“The global climate crisis is inextricably linked to water. Climate change increases variability in the water cycle, inducing extreme weather events, reducing the predictability of water availability, affecting water quality and threatening sustainable development and biodiversity worldwide.”</i> What this means is that, if the sustainability on our waters are not taken seriously, our biodiversity, natural habitats and ecosystem, will be in great danger. Therefore this means Earth's animals, species, and plants won’t have a home in our planet if we don’t protect our waters and take action.</p>
          <p>Another research on the sustainability of our waters can be found from the source, <i>“Aqua Tech.”</i> Aqua Tech is an organization that focuses on the trade of wastewater and drinking water. Aqua tech creates data charts and analytical observation of wastewater and drinking water from China, Mexico and Amsterdam. In the article,<i> “Sustainable Water: Our Essential Guide To Sustainable Water Resource Management Solutions & Strategies, Aquatech, 19 Aug, 2019,”</i> the research team provides helpful tips and solutions on how we can all be part of the sustainability of Earth’s fresh and clean water.</p>
          <ol type= "1">
           <li> Reduce the amount biowastes you contribute to Earth's atmosphere
          </li>
          <li> Sustain the amount of water you use; don't take long showers!</li>
          <li> Minimize the amount of electricity you use; unplug cables if you are not using the devices plugged into your outlets</li>
          <li> Understand that climate change is actually real and not a myth; spread awareness</li>

                  <b>Here are some helpful videos to understand the importance of water sustainability:.</b>

                <p align=""> The water cycle. “DIY Space: Global Warming Demonstration.” Youtube, uploaded by NASA, Jul 1, 2015.”

                  <p>With sustainability in our waters, no pollution will be added to the water cycle. Therefore when water evaporates,condensates and precipitates, carbon dioxide won’t be part of it’s cycle. It is our goal to terminate the excess of biowastes emitted onto our Earth's atmosphere, so that we can have fresher and cleaner water to drink and use. Biowastes can be found in unnatural gasses, electricity and oils we burn to create energy. Examples of these emitted gasses can be from: greenhouses, the burning of fossil fuels such as cars, high powered electricity and an extensive amount of electricity usage.</p>

              <p>CCH20 is devoted in providing analytical data and research to help create the cause of Water Sustainability. It is not an option to save our Earth, it is a duty.</p>
              <p>  Another helpful resource on the crisis of water Sustainability can be found in “The science of water sustainability” Youtube, uploaded by Al Jazeera, Techknow, April 24, 2017.”

                <p> Twelve percent of our Earth’s freshwater goes to Industrial areas. Twelve percent may not seem as high but in terms of our Earth’s water cycle, it recycles all the emitted gasses of carbon dioxide released from these industrial sites. Therefore  how much freshwater do we really have. </p>
