          <p>In 2019, the <i>“Un- Water policy”</i> by the United Nations created an analytical statement in the cause of water sustainability. In the first paragraph of the article, it says, <i>“The global climate crisis is inextricably linked to water. Climate change increases variability in the water cycle, inducing extreme weather events, reducing the predictability of water availability, affecting water quality and threatening sustainable development and biodiversity worldwide.”</i> What this means is that, if the sustainability on our waters are not taken seriously, our biodiversity, natural habitats and ecosystem, will be in great danger. Therefore this means Earth's animals, species, and plants won’t have a home in our planet if we don’t protect our waters and take action.</p>
          <p>Another research on the sustainability of our waters can be found from the source, <i>“Aqua Tech.”</i> Aqua Tech is an organization that focuses on the trade of wastewater and drinking water. Aqua tech creates data charts and analytical observation of wastewater and drinking water from China, Mexico and Amsterdam. In the article,<i> “Sustainable Water: Our Essential Guide To Sustainable Water Resource Management Solutions & Strategies, Aquatech, 19 Aug, 2019,”</i> the research team provides helpful tips and solutions on how we can all be part of the sustainability of Earth’s fresh and clean water.</p>
          <ol type= "1">
           <li> Reduce the amount biowastes you contribute to Earth's atmosphere
          </li>
          <li> Sustain the amount of water you use; don't take long showers!</li>
          <li> Minimize the amount of electricity you use; unplug cables if you are not using the devices plugged into your outlets</li>
          <li> Understand that climate change is actually real and not a myth; spread awareness</li>

                  <b>Here are some helpful videos to understand the importance of water sustainability:.</b>
                </p>
                <p align=""> The water cycle. “DIY Space: Global Warming Demonstration.” Youtube, uploaded by NASA, Jul 1, 2015.”

                  <p>Although the video focuses on natural disasters of  heat, it nonetheless emphasizes the fact that, if we continue to emit carbon dioxide, it will contribute to Earth’s natural disasters such as uncontrollable weather, but if we motinor the amount of pollution we emit onto Earth's atmosphere, we can improve on the variablity on our Earth's fresh and clean water. Examples of high emitted gasses can be the burning of fossile fuels, high powered electricity, greenhouse gasses, and carbon dioxide.</p>

              </article>
              <p>CCH20 is devoted in providing analytical data and research to help create the cause of Water Sustainability. It is not an option to save our Earth, it is a duty.</p>
              <p>  Another helpful resource on the crisis of water Sustainability can be found in “The science of water sustainability” Youtube, uploaded by Al Jazeera, Techknow, April 24, 2017.”
           </p>
              <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7K24pFmq22w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p> As said in, <ahref= https://youtu.be/7K24pFmq22w>“The science of water sustainability Youtube, uploaded by Al Jazeera, Techknow, April 24, 2017”</a> “Twelve percent of our Earth’s freshwater goes to Industrial areas.” Twelve percent may not seem as high, but in terms of our Earth’s water cycle, it recycles all the emitted gasses of carbon dioxide released from these industrial cites-gasses of carbon dioxide. Therefore how much freshwater do we really have?. </p>
                <br>
                <p>In Earth’s geographical landscaping, only 3% is covered in fresh and clean water. Therefore if 12% of our fresh and clean water goes to industrial cites, where does that leave room for the water we use such as drinking and usable water?
               <p>In <ahref= “https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water-in-agriculture”>The World Bank, Context, by Meriam Grey, May 08, 2020</a> about 40 percent of our food supply comes from agriculture. Farmers are dependent on fresh and clean water; agriculture is vital to human civilization. <ahref=”https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water-in-agriculture”>Water in Agriculture</a> says, “...agriculture represents 20 percent of the total cultivated land...Due to population growth, urbanization, and climate change, competition for water resources is expected to increase...”(Meriem Gray,May, 2008). What this means is that, plentiful water is not limited, it is unlimited. Therefore the lack of fresh and clean water, can lead to higher demands. If this happens, water will only be exclusive to those who can afford it. </p>
